## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![alt text](https://github.com/DrZubi/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/summary.PNG)
* The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance coefficients from the regression analysis provide non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset.
* The p-value is significantly smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. We can assume that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, conversely concluding that the slope of the linear model is not zero. 
* The linear model can predict MPG of Mechcar prototypes effectively because the model has an r-squared value of 0.7149. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Total Summary:

### Lot Summary:

The variance for the entire dataset indicates that the manufacturing data meets the 100 PSI variance requirement. However, when looking at the lot summary table, we can conclude that lot 3 is showing a larger variance than lots 1 and 2 and the performance and consistency of lot 3 would not meet the suspension coil requirement.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### T-Test on the Entire Lot

We fail to reject the null hypothesis (our significance level of 0.05). In other words, the sample mean may be equivalent to the true population mean. 

### T-Test on Three Plots

#### Lot 1:

Conclusion: We fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is equal to 1. 

#### Lot 2:

Conclusion: We fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is greater than 0.05. 

#### Lot 3:

Conclusion: We can reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is less than 0.05. The mean of the sample is significantly smaller than the previous two lots. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Study Focus: Look at the performance/cost index of MachaCar to their competitors.

### Metrics:
* Miles Per Gallon (MPG): Independent Variable
* Horsepower: Independent Variable 
* Engine Type (Hybrid, EV, Gas): Independent Variable
* Cost: Dependent Variable
* Safety Rating: Independent Variable
* Model Type (SUV, Coupe, Truck, Etc.): Independent Variable

### Hypothesis Testing:
* Null Hypothesis: MechaCar is performance/cost index is comparable to their competitors.
* Alternative Hypothesis: MechaCar is not comparable to their competitors. 

### Statistical Tests:
* Perform a multiple linear regression model to investigate the correlations between the independent and dependent variables. 

### Data needed:
This study would require collecting data on MechaCar and their competitorâ€™s car models and their performances.
